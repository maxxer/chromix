How to Use
-----------

### 1. Prior Work

This app is using Zabbix API,  
So, you should give API access authority.

* Zabbix 1.8:
    * Belong to "API access" group the users that you want to access.
* Zabbix over 2.0:
    * It is not necessary to the above work.
    * You just have to give access to the host to the user.

Please check the official document.  
[Zabbix Official Manual](http://www.zabbix.com/documentation/)

### 2. Installation

Please install the Chromix from the Chrome Web Store.  
[Chromix-Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/odjpdjeegacmncmodjbeboldofhljjjf,"Chromix")

### 3. Registration of Zabbix info

* Click Chromix icon on your chrome tool bar.
* Click "Add Zabbix".
* Fill in data about Zabbix.
    * If your Zabbix top url is "http://hostname/zabbix", the url column is filled in the box to this format "hostname/zabbix". 
    * If your Zabbix use "https", please check "SSL?" box.

### 4. Check the trigger

After this configure, chromix start monitoring trigger which status is "problem" automatically .
(Number of list item is only 100.)

### 5. Background

Chromix count the number of problems that occurred up to the current time from the last check of chromix.  
So, When you check the popup once, the number is reset.

### 6. Settings

At the chromix option page, you can set Desktop Notification feature.  
If you want to use Desktop Notification function, Please set "DesktopNotification" to "On".
And if you want to get Notification between maintenance time, Please set "Display notification for hosts in maintenance" to "On".
If "Display notirication for hosts in maintenance" set to off, chromix will not generate Notification and not change icon counter.

[Zabbix maintenance time](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/maintenance)

At this page, you can also change Background check rate and Notification display time.  
Default setting is 20 seconds.
